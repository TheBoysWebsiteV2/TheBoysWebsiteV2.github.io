      <h2>Funny Johnny</h2>
      <p>One day, I tried to take my comic, Funny Johnny, into school to give out to the boys at lunch time. Unfortunately the classroom assistant said they weren't allowed in school and never take them back in. So now I'm going to start scanning them with my printer so I can put them on our website. </p>
      <h2>Funny Street</h2>
      <p><i>Funny Street</i> is published weekly in <i>The Shop Magazine</i>.
      I'll start putting them up here, but only a once the next chapter is out in the magazine.
      Basically, one comes out in the magazine, nothing here. Another comes out in the next magazine, old one comes up here.</p>
      <p><i>This is enforced by The Shop</i></p>
